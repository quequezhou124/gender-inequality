Despite the improvement in the social spheres, disputes towards gender continue to manifest in numerous ways. Meanwhile, some bias are still influencing the new generations, which forms a vicious cycle. To jump out from this trap, we need to first, have a comprehensive understanding of the existing disparity. In this small cyberspace, we will see a wide variety of both online and offline communities with gender inequality.</p><style data-emotion="css gtvj52">.css-gtvj52{margin:0;font-family:"Roboto","Helvetica","Arial",sans-serif;font-weight:400;font-size:2.125rem;line-height:1.235;letter-spacing:0.00735em;margin-bottom:0.35em;}</style><h2 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h4 MuiTypography-gutterBottom css-gtvj52">Gender Inequality in Online Communities</h2><style data-emotion="css t1nuxs">.css-t1nuxs{margin:0;font-family:"Roboto","Helvetica","Arial",sans-serif;font-weight:400;font-size:1.5rem;line-height:1.334;letter-spacing:0em;margin-bottom:0.35em;}</style><h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h5 MuiTypography-gutterBottom css-t1nuxs">Social Media</h3><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-wje1bd">On many social media platforms, we can see a large amount of hate speech about women and non-binary individuals. A study by the Pew Research Center found that 41% of women have experienced online harassment. Particularly, stalking and sexual harassment happen to young women with a high frequency. This online environment is super unfriendly for women and sexual minority.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-wje1bd">Social media platform is like a mirror, reflecting the most authentic thoughts of users, as it provide masks for people to express their spite anonymously. Therefore, we can see the chains that bind women from the society never disappear. And even in the 21st century, there are still women dead from cyberbully based on sexual bias.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-wje1bd">On February 19, 2023, 24-year-old Hangzhou girl Zheng Linghua suicide by jumping off, according to Qianjiang Evening News, one of her high school friends confirmed that the news was true. In July 2022, Zheng Linghua shared her offer of graduate application with her grandfather in front of the hospital bed, and was abused on the internet because of his pink hair.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-wje1bd">The stereotypes like girls who like dressing up cannot succeed, girls are born to be bad at science subjects and girls need to be beautiful and stupid to win boys’ heart still exist and is spreading on the internet. These kind of comments reinforce people&#x27;s impression, and amplifies the seriousness of the gender issue.</p><h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h5 MuiTypography-gutterBottom css-t1nuxs">Gaming Communities</h3><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-wje1bd">Another area, where gender inequality is obvious, is game industry. Female gamers encounter exclusion frequently. The Gamergate (an online harassment campaign in that targeted women in the video game industry) controversy indicates the toxic and traditional culture in gaming communities. While the number of female gamers is growing, women are not respected. The gender issue appears not only in being called unfit for video games, but also in the women game characters. While the male characters in fighting games are always in body armor, helmet and knee pads, women characters are usually in revealing outfits, such as bikini. However, the game developers should know that everyone need an appropriate costume to protect themselves in a fight. Although they are just fictional images, it still shows that the requirement from the society for women is only being a pretty flower vase.</p><h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h5 MuiTypography-gutterBottom css-t1nuxs">Representation in Media</h3><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-wje1bd">Digital media often underrepresents or stereotypically portrays women and gender minorities. These posts reinforce harmful stereotypes and make these groups isolated. For instance, in May 2024, a post spread widely online, saying a 21-year-old man &quot;Fat Cat&quot; sent his online girlfriend 500,000 yuan, and suicide by jumping into the river after breaking up. Before the police announced the clarification, &quot;Fat Cat&quot;’s online girlfriend suffered serious cyber manhunt and cyberbully. She was called gold digger at that time. Unexpectedly, it tuned out that &quot;Fat Cat&quot;’s online girlfriend even gave &quot;Fat Cat&quot; more money than he sent. The same events happens frequently, and the reason behind it is because most people are only able to see what they want to see. They prefer to believe that beautiful girls always date with men for money.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-wje1bd">Besides fake news, female characters created by males always be given the sexualized elements in films, novels and media. This phenomenon is caused by the &quot;male gaze&quot;. And it has profound implications for the representation of women’ gender role on the media and in the real life. For example, a popular label, called &quot;cool girl&quot;, is describing the character is not only physically attractive but also embodies traits that appeal to male audiences, such as a laid-back attitude and a willingness to engage in traditionally male activities. This stereotype reinforces the idea that women&#x27;s value lies in their ability to satisfy male expectations. And male writers and directors always let their women character to dress in sexy outfit which is inappropriate and uncomfortable for their jobs. One notable example of a female character who is skilled, but often dress in revealing outfits is Ada Wong from the Resident Evil franchise. Created by Shinji Mikami, a male writer. Ada Wong is portrayed as a highly expertised spy. Despite her skills and importance to the storyline, she is always shown wearing tight, revealing clothing.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-wje1bd">The sexualization of female characters affects how audiences perceive and interact with women in real life. This can lead to harmful consequences, including reduced self-esteem, and the gender harassment.</p><h2 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h4 MuiTypography-gutterBottom css-gtvj52">Gender Inequality in Offline Communities</h2><h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h5 MuiTypography-gutterBottom css-t1nuxs">Workplace Disparities</h3><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-wje1bd">Gender inequality in the workplace is till common to see nowadays, which can be noticed in the distinct salary and promotion opportunities. Women, especially women of color, face an income gap, and it is less possible for them to be on the leader positions with similar level of ability to their peers. According to the World Economic Forum, it will take over 135 years for the global gender income gap to converge at the current rate of progress.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-wje1bd">Moreover, the stereotype of which gender should choose which career will affect people’s choice. Nurses are females, while doctors are males is a typical example, and even ChatGPT will use pronounce she/her for nurses and he/him for doctors when there is no indication to their genders. When I ask it for the reason why it used the pronouns, it confessed the use of &quot;she&quot; for the nurse and &quot;he&quot; for the doctor reflects long-standing gender stereotypes that are prevalent in society.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-wje1bd">In addition, most social attitudes towards the housewife and mother diminished their contribution, leading to...</p></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/essay","query":{},"buildId":"mChgg5PNqnZLMOiuNCaCi","assetPrefix":"/gender-inequality","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
