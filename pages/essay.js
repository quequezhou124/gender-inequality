        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          Another area, where gender inequality is obvious, is game industry. Female gamers encounter exclusion frequently. The Gamergate (an online harassment campaign in that targeted women in the video game industry) controversy indicates the toxic and traditional culture in gaming communities. While the number of female gamers is growing, women are not respected. The gender issue appears not only in being called unfit for video games, but also in the women game characters. While the male characters in fighting games are always in body armor, helmet and knee pads, women characters are usually in revealing outfits, such as bikini. However, the game developers should know that everyone need an appropriate costume to protect themselves in a fight. Although they are just fictional images, it still shows that the requirement from the society for women is only being a pretty flower vase.

        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          Digital media often underrepresents or stereotypically portrays women and gender minorities. These posts reinforce harmful stereotypes and make these groups isolated. For instance, in May 2024, a post spread widely online, saying a 21-year-old man "Fat Cat" sent his online girlfriend 500,000 yuan, and suicide by jumping into the river after breaking up. Before the police announced the clarification, "Fat Cat"’s online girlfriend suffered serious cyber manhunt and cyberbully. She was called gold digger at that time. Unexpectedly, it tuned out that "Fat Cat"’s online girlfriend even gave "Fat Cat" more money than he sent. The same events happens frequently, and the reason behind it is because most people are only able to see what they want to see. They prefer to believe that beautiful girls always date with men for money.

          Besides fake news, female characters created by males always be given the sexualized elements in films, novels and media. This phenomenon is caused by the "male gaze". And it has profound implications for the representation of women’ gender role on the media and in the real life. For example, a popular label, called "cool girl", is describing the character is not only physically attractive but also embodies traits that appeal to male audiences, such as a laid-back attitude and a willingness to engage in traditionally male activities. This stereotype reinforces the idea that women's value lies in their ability to satisfy male expectations.

Ada Wong is portrayed as a highly expertised spy. Despite her skills and importance to the storyline, she is always shown wearing tight, revealing clothing.
