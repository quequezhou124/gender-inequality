This phenomenon is caused by the &quot;male gaze&quot;. And it has profound implications for the representation of women’ gender role on the media and in the real life. For example, a popular label, called &quot;cool girl&quot;, is describing the <span class="css-i7ft2s">character is not only physically attractive but also embodies traits that appeal to male audiences, such as a laid-back attitude and a willingness to engage in traditionally male activities</span>. This stereotype reinforces the idea that women&#x27;s value lies in their ability to satisfy male expectations. And male writers and directors always let their women character to dress in sexy outfit which is inappropriate and uncomfortable for their jobs. <span class="css-dx1dh7"> One notable example of a female character who is skilled, but often dress in revealing outfits is Ada Wong from the Resident Evil franchise.
